This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(grid)
nums <- sapply(diamonds,is.numeric)
Test_frame <- diamonds[,nums]
for (i in 1:(length(Test_frame)-1)){
  for (j in (i+1):length(Test_frame)){
    Test_plot <- ggplot(Test_frame, aes(Test_frame[[i]],Test_frame[[j]]))
    Test_plot <- Test_plot + geom_point()
    print(Test_plot)
  }
}
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
